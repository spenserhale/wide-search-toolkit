description: Where to find what this project does, why it works that way, and how each change was planned.

| Folder | What lives there |
|---|---|
| `product/` | Who this is for, what it is not, and how success is measured |
| `specs/` | What each feature does today, one file per feature |
| `decisions/` | Why things are the way they are, one record per decision |
| `plans/` | How each change was designed and built, one file per change |
| `guides/` | Engineering conventions: vendors, security, testing |

`specs/`, `decisions/`, and `plans/` each have a `_template.md` to copy. The rules for keeping these current (specs change with the code, decisions are superseded instead of rewritten, commits carry code, tests, and docs together) are in `AGENTS.md` at the repo root.

The generated CLI skill lives at [`../wide-search-cli/SKILL.md`](../wide-search-cli/SKILL.md).
